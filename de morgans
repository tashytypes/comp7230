'''De Morgan's laws give us a way of simplifying logical expressions. Using them we can move negations into and out of brackets containing conjunctions and disjunctions.

Use De Morgan's laws to push all the negations inside the brackets in lines 7 and 8 in the following code.'''

x = True
y = True
z = False

# TO DO: Use De Morgan's laws to push all negations inside the brackets
# in lines 7 and 8 of the code. Do not change any other lines.
a = (( x and y) or ( y))
b = not((x or not z) and not(y or z))

print(a)
print(b)
